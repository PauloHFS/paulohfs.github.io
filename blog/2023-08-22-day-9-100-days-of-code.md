Today was a hard, I had to update the typescript of a old project so I had to study about the typescript [module resolution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html) and the [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) file.

I also studied about Circuit Break and how to implement it in a NodeJS project, I will write about it in the next days.

References that I used to study:
