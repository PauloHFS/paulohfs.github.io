Today was a slow day for me, I can't concentrate to study, but I do some things.

- Study about Concurrency and Parallelism in general. I see the diferences an learning that they are concepts that are related, but not the same thing. I write a [node](https://paulohfs.github.io//my-brain/concurrent-programming/concurrency-vs-parallelism) about it.
- I study Golang, start to build a Rest API using a tutorial, but I don't finish it because I fell that I need to learn more about the syntax and the language itself. So I build a validate CPF function with some unit tests, and I learn about the `go test` command. The validate CPF is a nice function to implement in a new language because its need a lot of things like: string manipulation, loops, type conversion, and more. So it is nice to now what you need to now about a new language!
