Today I was very busy with work and college, but I managed to study, so I see this topics today:

I do this in a old work project, I rework the configuration because was old and broken, so I can't share the code, but I will try to do a post about this topics soon.

- [How to configure Typescript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/typescript-new-project) with [nodemon](https://blog.logrocket.com/configuring-nodemon-with-typescript/) and ts-node to run a NodeJS project on development mode. I hade some problems with the ESM, that make me see more about use `nodenext` in the tscompiler configuration.
- How to configure ESLint and Prettier to work with Typescript.
- How to configure the build in this configuration. aka `tsc --build` and `tsc --watch`.
- How to use zod to validate data in Typescript. I used this library to [parse the .env file](https://sergiodxa.com/articles/using-zod-to-safely-read-env-variables) and validate the environment variables.
