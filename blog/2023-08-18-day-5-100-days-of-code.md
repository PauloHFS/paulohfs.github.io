Today was nice, I study lot of things and at the end of the day I release a game!

I tested the SWC to transpile the ts code, and I setup this to work on a project at work. At afternoon I study about Object Relational Database in college, so I do a little [experiments](https://paulohfs.github.io//my-brain/databases/exercicies/in-class-exercice-1) with my professor. At night I studied Godot, and build the 2D game tutorial and release it, you can download it [here](https://github.com/PauloHFS/dodge-the-creeps). I learn a lot of GDScript and the godot engine like: scenes, signals, animation, and more. Was a nice day.
