Today I study about about Machine Learning, specifically about the K-Means Clustering Algorithm, you can see my notes [here](https://paulohfs.github.io//my-brain/data-science/machine-learning/k-means-clustering), and the code [here](https://github.com/PauloHFS/descriptive-data-analysis-2023-1).

- [x] Study about K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- [x] Study about Expectation Maximization Algorithm
- [x] Study about Elbow Method to find the best number of clusters
- [x] Done notebook on college for the K-Means Clustering Algorithm
