            <description><![CDATA[Study a lot about node js and legacy code]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today at work I had to start to study a legacy code that I will work with new features soon, to make my life more easy I start doing some this:</p><ul><li>Create a Wiki to document the project</li><li>Search for all the deploys and the history of the project</li><li>Add Sentry to monitor the errors on live project</li><li>Update some dependencies</li><li>Update the build process to use the new version of node, and add some new features to the build process (need by some dependencies)</li></ul><p>Also at the end of the day I continue to build my POC to test some concepts, today I decided what problem I want to solve. The problem is, I want to process some data using some async data handler, this handler has rate limit and can fail in process data, so I need to implement a solution to retry some times I want, need to handle the rate limit and need to build a circuit breaker to handle the errors, also the handler is in a pipeline, if a handler fail the next handler will be called and the have the same problem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I see the diferences an learning that they are concepts that are related, but not the same thing. I write a <a href="https://paulohfs.github.io//my-brain/concurrent-programming/concurrency-vs-parallelism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">node</a> about it.</li><li>I study Golang, start to build a Rest API using a tutorial, but I don't finish it because I fell that I need to learn more about the syntax and the language itself. So I build a validate CPF function with some unit tests, and I learn about the <code>go test</code> command. The validate CPF is a nice function to implement in a new language because its need a lot of things like: string manipulation, loops, type conversion, and more. So it is nice to now what you need to now about a new language!</li></ul><p>Want to know about the 100 Days of Code Challenge?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today was nice, I study lot of things and at the end of the day I release a game!</p><p>I tested the SWC to transpile the ts code, and I setup this to work on a project at work. At afternoon I study about Object Relational Database in college, so I do a little <a href="https://paulohfs.github.io//my-brain/databases/exercicies/in-class-exercice-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiments</a> with my professor. At night I studied Godot, and build the 2D game tutorial and release it, you can download it <a href="https://github.com/PauloHFS/dodge-the-creeps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I learn a lot of GDScript and the godot engine like: scenes, signals, animation, and more. Was a nice day.</p><p>Want to know about the 100 Days of Code Challenge?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I finished the second lab for my Data Science class, I used Pandas and <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seaborn</a> library to plot some histograms and boxplots, maybe I would write a post about it soon. You can check the notebook <a href="https://github.com/PauloHFS/descriptive-data-analysis-2023-1/blob/main/Lab2A_EDA%2C_Histogramas%2C_Sumarizacao.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>I also study English and Concurrent Programming to a exam that I will have tomorrow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today was a really full day of work, I have been working to finish a project that I have been working on for a while from the company that I work for, so I didn't have much time to code, but I managed to do some things.</p><p>First of all I study again some concepts of Data Structure, more precisely, about the Binary Search Tree, I have been studying this topic for a while at the college, but I think that I need to study more about it because a will need to use this concepts soon on a exam, so I will do it in the next days. <a href="https://github.com/PauloHFS/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/data-structures/tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is the code that I wrote today and some references that I used to study.</p><p>After that I work a lot to finish a project for the company that I work. As good cause I can apply some concepts that I learn about Next.js and Typescript like <a href="https://formidable.com/blog/2021/react-composition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Composition</a> as a example.</p><p>At the end of the day I had a English Class that we discussed about the weather, before that I call with my cousin that is a SE in a company from Canada, we talk a lot about my graduation, my studies, jobs in SE, immigration and english, was really nice to collects some career insights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[How to build a core routine!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Code is a skill that you need to practice every day. But some days we don't are in the mood to code, but we fell anxious about it. So, I will share with you some tips that I use to code every day.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-create-a-routine">1. Create a routine<a href="#1-create-a-routine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Create a routine" title="Direct link to 1. Create a routine">​</a></h2><p>The first step is to create a routine. You need to define a time to code every day. It can be 30 minutes, 1 hour, or more. The important thing is to code every day.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-create-a-coding-menu">2. Create a Coding Menu<a href="#2-create-a-coding-menu" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Create a Coding Menu" title="Direct link to 2. Create a Coding Menu">​</a></h2><p>Some times we want to code but we don't know what to. So create a Coding Menu that you can always look and choose a thing to code based on the time and mood that you have.</p><p>A Coding Menu is a list of projects/exercises that you may want to work on. You need to split they on blocks of times, for example, a exercise that you can do in 30 minutes, a project that you can do in 1 hour, and so on. A example:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Time</th><th>Activity</th><th>Links/Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>30 minutes</td><td>Micro-Projects</td><td><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/</a></td></tr><tr><td>30 minutes</td><td>Programming Challenges</td><td><a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://leetcode.com/</a></td></tr><tr><td>1 hour</td><td>Plan &amp; Build a Project</td><td>Create something that you may use</td></tr><tr><td>1 hour</td><td>Study alongside you apply</td><td><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/</a></td></tr><tr><td>2.5+ hours</td><td>Work on a Project</td><td>Work hard on a project that you want to finish</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Time is just a example, you can change it to fit your routine. Always ask how much time do you have!</em></p><p><em>Activity is just a example, must be something fun that you can do, try to build projects!</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="userful-links">Userful Links<a href="#userful-links" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Userful Links" title="Direct link to Userful Links">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://youtu.be/a0eB7tMkvs4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How To Code Everyday - bigboxSWE</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
