Today I had a Data Science class and I learned about correlation.You can see my notes [here](https://paulohfs.github.io//my-brain/data-science/correlation), they are incomplete but at the end of this week I will complete them whem reviewing the content to work on a dataset that I had to finish until thursday.

After that I had some mentorship about distributed systems and some projects to build to improve my skills, you can see the notes [here](https://paulohfs.github.io//my-brain/system-design).
