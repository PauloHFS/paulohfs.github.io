Today I started studying Go by doing the exercises in the repository of [@wagslane](https://twitter.com/wagslane) <https://github.com/bootdotdev/fcc-learn-golang-assets>.

In the afternoon I had a data science class in the college and I did an evaluation on histogram interpretation, besides that I started to do an exploratory analysis of the following dataset [Students Performace in Exams](https://kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) that will validate a laboratory grade in this discipline.

At night I studied the concept of [Conditional Variable](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-cv.pdf) that in concurrent programming causes a thread to wait for another to execute, the famous join()!
