# How to Code Everyday

Code is a skill that you need to practice every day. But some days we don't are in the mood to code, but we fell anxious about it. So, I will share with you some tips that I use to code every day.

## 1. Create a routine

The first step is to create a routine. You need to define a time to code every day. It can be 30 minutes, 1 hour, or more. The important thing is to code every day.

## 2. Create a Coding Menu

Some times we want to code but we don't know what to. So create a Coding Menu that you can always look and choose a thing to code based on the time and mood that you have.

A Coding Menu is a list of projects/exercises that you may want to work on. You need to split they on blocks of times, for example, a exercise that you can do in 30 minutes, a project that you can do in 1 hour, and so on. A example:

| Time | Activity | Links/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 30 minutes | Micro-Projects | <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/> |
| 30 minutes | Programming Challenges | <https://leetcode.com/> |
| 1 hour | Plan & Build a Project | Create something that you may use |
| 1 hour | Study alongside you apply | <https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/> |
| 2.5+ hours | Work on a Project | Work hard on a project that you want to finish |

*Time is just a example, you can change it to fit your routine. Always ask how much time do you have!*

*Activity is just a example, must be something fun that you can do, try to build projects!*
