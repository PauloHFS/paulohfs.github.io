A driver is a piece of software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware devices. It acts as a translator between the hardware and the software, allowing the operating system to send commands to the hardware and receive data from it.

There are three main types of drivers in Linux:

- **Character drivers**: These drivers handle devices that transfer data one character at a time, such as keyboards, mice, and serial ports.

- **Block drivers**: These drivers handle devices that transfer data in blocks, such as hard drives and USB drives.

- **Network drivers**: These drivers handle network devices, such as Ethernet cards and wireless adapters.
