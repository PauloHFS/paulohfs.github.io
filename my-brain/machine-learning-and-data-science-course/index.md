### Machine Learning

We can divide the machine learning in two methods:

Predictive: The model learns from the data to make predictions.

- Classification: The model predicts a category.
- Regression: The model predicts a continuous value.

Descriptive: The model learns from the data to describe the data.

- Clustering: The model groups similar data.
- Association: The model finds rules that describe the data.
- Sumarization: The model summarizes the data.
- Sequence discovery: The model finds patterns in the data.
- Anomaly detection: The model finds outliers in the data.

### Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised: The model learns from labeled data.
- Unsupervised: The model learns from unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement: The model learns from rewards and punishments.
