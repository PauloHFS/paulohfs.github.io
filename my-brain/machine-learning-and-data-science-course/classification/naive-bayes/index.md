Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is simple and fast, and it is often used as a baseline for comparison with other more complex algorithms.

This use a probabilistic approach (Bayes' theorem) to classify data. It assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

Examples:

- Spam detection
- Sentiment analysis
- Document classification
