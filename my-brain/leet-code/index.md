I'm using this page to document my Leet Code journey. I'll be adding notes on different topics and problems that I solve on Leet Code.

[Neet Code](https://neetcode.io/)

Some Tips:

1. Solve problems in order of difficulty.
2. Try to do the worst time complexity solution first and then optimize it.
