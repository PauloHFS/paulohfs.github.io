Scenes are the components/objects of the game. We can break down a game in a lot of reusable scenes. The scenes are composed of nodes, that can be anything from a sprite to a camera.

As a example, the player is a scene, the enemies are scenes, the bullets are scenes, the background is a scene, the UI is a scene, etc.

## Scene tree

The scene tree is a tree structure that holds all the scenes of the game. The root of the tree is the main scene, and it can have children scenes.

You can think the a level of a game as a scene, that have a lot of children scenes, like the player, the enemies, the background, etc.
